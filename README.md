# LITA-Capstone-Project
This is a Sales and Customer analyses project being submitted to Incubator Hub as part of my learning.
### Project Title: Capstone Business Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the sales and customer performance of the Capstone Business over the past two years. This project collects and analyses sales data from various regions, dates, customers and products. The goal is to provide insights into revenue, quantities sold and transaction categories over different periods. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue trends and sales performance across regions and calculating key metrics such as average revenue by region. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight that will help us tell compelling stories around our data, know the best performances from our data and  make sound decisions.
